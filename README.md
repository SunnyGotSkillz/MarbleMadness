To see what the game looks like in action:

Windows: 
1. Download the MarbleMadness folder to your desktop. In that desktop folder, double-click on the MarbleMadness application. (If the program crashes after 1 to 30 seconds with a dialog box showing an error code 0xc0000022, try disabling your antivirus software.)

macOS: 
1. You'll need to have XQuartz installed to run the program.
Install XQuartz:
  - Click the download link, open the downloaded .pkg file, XQuartz.pkg, and follow the installation instructions.
  - Log out and log back in again.
  - To verify the installation, open a Terminal window and run the command echo $DISPLAY. That should produce one line of output that ends with org.xquartz:0.
2. Download MarbleMadness
3. Locate the folder MarbleMadness, which should have in it files named MarbleMadness and Assets.  It's likely that the path to the folder will be
/Users/yourname/MarbleMadness or /Users/yourname/Downloads/MarbleMadness.
4. Open a Terminal window and type
        cd whateverThePathIs
where you should replace whateverThePathIs with the path to the
MarbleMadness folder.
5. Type
        ./MarbleMadness
to play the game.
